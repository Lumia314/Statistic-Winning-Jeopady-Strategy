# Winning Jeopardy Strategy
## Introduction
Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. Let's say you want to compete on Jeopardy, and you're looking for any edge you can get to win. In this project, you'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.
## Dataset
The dataset contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which you can find here:
